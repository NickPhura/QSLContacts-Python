### public

> The root level index.html that is the parents for all other html pages/elements.

### src

#### actions
> Action creators.  Functions that return action objects.

#### components
> Concered with only rendering UI elements.  If data is needed, it should be passed to it by a container (see _containers_ below). Not all components will need data.

#### constants
> System constants. For example, the action types should be defined here.

#### containers
> Counterparts to components.  Containers get data from the state, parse it, and pass it to the component.  Any logic or data manipulation should happen here, so that the component can be as dumb as possible.

#### selectors
> Functions that provide access to parts of the state that are used often and by many components, thus warranting its own selector.

#### store
> The configuration/instantiation of the state store object.  All data that the app uses should be saved in the state.
